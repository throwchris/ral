    <p class="w3-justify">We are back to first grade again, but we are learning something out of it, aren't we? I imagine that he felt like just walking off and say forget it, just in almost 
      despair, groaned within himself.  And when we hear the same Word over and over and over and over again about life, and the Lord moves on me at home with such an anointing and such power 
      to give these messages out, and I must teach them.  And it has been over and over and over and yet we have to learn them over every week.  Or we let them slip, you see, the Word of God.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong style="color: #ffd700" >John 12:23-50</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-green"> And Jesus answered them, saying,<span class="w3-text-red"> The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a 
      corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</span></strong>  All right.  Here is another thing that he is saying that says 
      the same thing.  He said I will die.  I have to fall into the ground and die that I might bring forth many after my own kind with a glorified body.  Now he wasn't talking about the 
      resurrection especially here because that had already been established. <span class="w3-text-red">He that loveth his life shall lose it;</span> If you love your life so much that you want 
      to live it your own way, you will sure lose it.  But if you give your life completely and totally to the Lord and do what he wants you to do and be willing to give up that what he takes 
      away from you, then you will live forever. <strong class="w3-text-light-green"><strong class="w3-text-red">and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. If any man serve me, let him follow me; and 
      where I am, there shall also my servant be:</strong></strong>  All right, now where is he?  In the spirit, in a glorified body.  He can appear and disappear or whatever he wants to be.
     <strong class="w3-text-light-green"><span class="w3-text-red">If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be:</span></strong>  Now if that is a mystery to you, it shouldn't be.  
      He wants a people that will be exactly like he is now, in his glorified state. <strong class="w3-text-light-green"><span class="w3-text-red">if any man serve me, him will my Father honour. Now is my soul troubled; 
      and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour:</span></strong>  He was facing the cross. <strong class="w3-text-light-green"><span class="w3-text-red">but for this cause came I unto this hour.</span></strong> 
      That he might be a firstfruits of many brethren. <strong class="w3-text-light-green"><span class="w3-text-red">Father, glorify thy name.</span> Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, 
      and will glorify it again. The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. Jesus answered and said,</strong> 
      <strong><span class="w3-text-red">This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</span></strong>  That you might come out of this and believe.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-green"><span class="w3-text-red">Now is the 
      judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</span></strong>  Now, it didn't happen that day, did it, that the prince of this world was cast out which is Satan?  
      But the way was made.  He knew that his death and his resurrection and the guy that had the power over death would be taken out: that the way was made. <strong class="w3-text-light-green"><span class="w3-text-red">
      And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</span> This he said, signifying what death he should die.</strong>  The work has already been done.  You see we lift 
      Christ up – well, we are supposed to lift him up of course, but he was speaking of his death here, being crucified. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that 
      Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou,</strong> <strong class="w3-text-light-green"><span class="w3-text-red"> The Son of man must be lifted up?</span> who is this Son of man?</strong>  Think of it.  Sitting 
      right there and saying I am the resurrection.  I am the life.  You wonder why he groaned. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Then Jesus said unto them,<span class="w3-text-red"> Yet a little while is the light with 
      you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be 
      the children of light. </span></strong> </p>

      <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 7</p>
     
    <p class="w3-justify">What's the children of light?</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">The children of the kingdom are the children of light.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-green">These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</strong>  He just had all he could take, didn't he?  He went and just hid himself.  
      Enough of their unbelief and so on and so forth. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</strong>  Do you see why he hid?  Do you think 
      he hides sometimes from us?  When he gives us the Word and everything and the anointing of the Spirit and the spirit of revelation and tells us so plainly in his Word what he came to do.  
      You don't think he just came for the resurrection do you?  He came to break the curse and restore to man what Adam had thrown away, giving it to Satan.  That is what he came to restore, 
      all things, not just some things.  He came to restore life unto man that he would not have to die because death is the curse and the curse is sin.  Right?  Jesus didn't look back just as 
      far as the beginning of the law.  He looked back clear unto Adam, what Adam and Eve had thrown away by disobeying and letting the curse come upon all men. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">That the saying of 
      Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? Therefore they could not believe, because 
      that Esaias said again, He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see</strong>  He said God did this. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, 
      and be converted,</strong>  You know what converted means, to change around or change your belief. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">and I should heal them. These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake 
      of him.</strong>  He had a vision of the glory of Christ. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him;</strong>  Now look, <strong class="w3-text-light-green">but because of the Pharisees they did not 
      confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</strong>  What's your excuse for not believing the message?  Are you afraid people won't understand and they'll just call you a 
      heretic or something?  Is that why?  Afraid they might take your life, or try to, if we stand for truth? <strong class="w3-text-light-green">For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</strong>  Boy, this old 
      flesh is a tricky bugger, isn't it? <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Jesus cried and said, <span class="w3-text-red">He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. And he that seeth me seeth him 
      that sent me.</span></strong>  Which is the Father. <strong class="w3-text-light-green"><span class="w3-text-red">I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. And if 
      any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that 
      judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</span></strong>  Now these people that couldn't see this back in the former days because it was not 
      given to them.  Their eyes were darkened and their ears were closed.  But now the revelation of Jesus Christ is coming forth.<strong class="w3-text-light-green"><span class="w3-text-red"> For I have not spoken of 
      myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak 
      therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</span></strong> </p>

      <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 8</p>
      
    <p class="w3-justify">Now look.  They knew there was a resurrection although the word is not in the Bible (the Old Testament).  They knew there was going to be a change.  They knew it by the 
      Spirit of God. </p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong style="color: #ffd700">Job 19:25-26</strong> <strong class="w3-text-light-green"></strong>For I know that my redeemer liveth,</strong>  Looking forward to Christ, long before Christ was born. 
      <strong class="w3-text-light-green">and that he shall stand at the latter 
      day upon the earth:</strong>  Isn't he?  In man.  Amen.  Well he is, isn't he?  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And though after my skin worms destroy this</strong>  flesh 
      <strong class="w3-text-light-green">body, yet in my 
      flesh</strong>  A new flesh, even though the worms had destroyed this natural flesh body. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">yet in my flesh shall I see God:</strong>  This sounds like 
      a riddle almost if you didn't 
      understand it, doesn't it?  Even though the flesh would be destroyed, his natural flesh.  The skin worms destroy his natural flesh.  Now he had been dead long, so he is probably nothing 
      but powder probably.  Yet he knew that in his flesh, at the resurrection, he would see God.  On the earth, that he would see him – on the earth, not off somewhere.  He is talking about a 
      glorified body.  Yes, absolutely, absolutely, that he would receive a glorified body, a body not made with hands: in the heavens, amen or in the spirit, reserved.  That's what the Bible 
      says, for those that have to go by the way of death. Jesus came back, when they said you are a spirit.  He said a spirit hath not flesh and bone.  Put your fingers in those holes where I 
      was crucified.  Thrust your hand in my side.  Then he said now, do you have something to eat?  And he ate with them.  Do you see what he is saying?  We are not going to be just spirit.  
      It will be a body that is changed where there are no limitations to it.  That's the inheritance.  That is what the inheritance is that the Lord speaks of.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">It's a full redemption.  That's the redemption, even the full redemption, the redemption of our bodies. It doesn't say the resurrection of the body.  It says the redemption of the body.  
      Amen. How did Job know that?  How did he know that God was charging him?  How did he know that God was testing him?  By the spirit.  How did Abraham know that he was to go out and search 
      for another country?  By the spirit.  Same God – faith.  Amen.  And God spoke to them.  He had prophets in the land. I believe that he (Job) was raised up and walked the walk that he 
      walked in the power of the Lord in order – and you remember Christ was with them back then, too, you know, just like he is now with us.  But he had to abide under that law, at that time, 
      the dispensation that they lived in.  But I believe that he was raised up for that purpose so we would know and understand how Satan can't touch us except God allow it.  And he fulfilled 
      the blessing of God, such a greater blessing, even though he had taken everything from him, and not to get discouraged every time some little thing happens to you, or you come even close 
      to death, but to know that you might be a testimony to others.</p>

      <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 9</p>
      
    
    <p class="w3-justify">We don't know what is going on around us, like when he said some of us entertain strangers unaware, remember the angels.  Well, 'angel' is messenger.  You've heard through 
      the years of many people that have appeared, and ridden and got in the car.  Do you remember brother Klems,
      when that angel got in the car with him when he was leaving a meeting someplace.  And he looked over and there was a man sitting next to him with a brown coat and a brown hat.  And he 
      said it scared him almost to death.  He said I actually pinched myself to see if I had gone to sleep at the wheel.  So the angel said to him, or the man, whoever it was – maybe it was 
      John, maybe it was Paul, maybe it was Elijah, who knows?  Because they have glorified bodies.  The angel said to him, when he pinched himself, he said you don't need to pinch yourself.  
      I am real.  You are not asleep.  We know this man very well, brother Klems.  He said he doesn't remember driving the car from then on.  I forget how many miles, 25 miles I'll say or so.  
      He drove, and this man was talking to him about his ministry all of the way, and talked just like anybody else.  He said I've come and I have a  message to you from the Father.  He wants 
      to encourage you and tell you what you are going to do and all of this and that.  The reason he knows how far it was because he became conscious of the sign that said 'City so and so' – 
      what city it was – and then the angel just disappeared.  But he rode with him all of those miles and talked with him.  He said somehow that angel had control of the car, but he was 
      sitting in the driver's seat and took him all the way there.  So who knows who it was?</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">And I know that at least three times that brother Parsons had visitors come in his car and sit when he was driving.  He even air-conditioned his car through the 
      desert.  As long as the angel was in the car, the car was air-conditioned.  We know these things, people that I have much confidence in, that are honest, sincere ministers, and many 
      others, and many others, and many others that have had visitations from the Lord.  So when he says that some have entertained angels unaware, or messengers or visitors.  Angel means the 
      same thing.  It is in Greek.  It doesn't mean just angels, somebody with wings and white robes.  Amen.  They can be visitors.  'Messengers' is really what it means.</p>

      <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 10</p>
      
      <p class="w3-justify">This is the hour.  This is the time because the revealing, the seals are opened.  Amen. I've seen multitudes, multitudes of angels, I mean until you couldn't count 
      them.  And they were hovering over me.  Just faces is all you could see.  The first ones you could see were in this angle like this, and like this, going out this way, the multitude.  
      Just like a shaft almost, of angels all around me, just multitudes of them.  It was just a glorious, glorious experience, the presence of the Lord.  It would almost take your breath 
      away.  They are real, believe me.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong style="color: #ffd700">5:21-6:23</strong>  <strong class="w3-text-light-green">That as sin hath reigned unto death,</strong> In other words, death is sin and sin has reigned unto death.  Do you get what it is saying?  
      Sin is the cause of death and it has been reigning for a long time, since the first beginning when Adam sinned.  Sin has reigned unto death. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">even so might grace reign</strong> This 
      free gift of God which is life. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">through righteousness</strong>  That's the only way you are coming into it, through righteousness. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our

      How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</strong> Let's read two again because it is very precious. God forbid. That we should sin or increase in sin. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">How 
      shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</strong>  All right.  Boy, I don't 
      know if I can put this into the words that I want to put it into.  We were baptized into the same thing he was baptized in death.  As we accept him and are baptized, we are baptized into 
      his death also.  We've died just like he died, as far as God is concerned.  Now just hang on. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death:</strong> The work has been done.
    <strong class="w3-text-light-green">that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</strong>  Don't be looking for death, be looking for life.  
     Did you get that?  Well, let's do it again.  Verse three, because this is very important. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Know ye not,</strong>  He says don't you know? <strong class="w3-text-light-green">that so many of us as were baptized 
     into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</strong>  he same as he did, buried alive with him in the water when we were baptized, when we accepted the fullness of his Spirit and so on and 
     so forth.  That he could set others free from death. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Therefore we are buried with him</strong> He says we are, if we'll accept it by faith. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">we are buried with him by 
      baptism into death:</strong> That is, we partook of his death also because he was killed and buried, so were we killed and buried.  He did the work that we wouldn't have to be. 
      <strong class="w3-text-light-green">that like as Christ</strong>  Just like Christ. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</strong> 
      Like he did in a resurrected body.  That is what he wants.  If you want it any plainer than that I don't know where to find it.  And they have always likened it unto, 
      "Well you have got to die anyhow."  But that isn't what he is saying. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness 
      of his resurrection:</strong>  What did he come like in his resurrection?  See, it doesn't say that we're going to be…, oh boy, let's read it again.  You have got to get a hold of this.
    <strong class="w3-text-light-green">For if we have been planted together</strong>  With Christ. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">in the likeness of his death,</strong>  If we have died with him by the work he did in the spirit. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">we

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 12</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify">If you believe this you will live forever.  Amen.  You don't have to die.  Now the reason we have to teach this is because it is the Word of God and somebody has 
    got to teach the Word of God and set the world free.  Amen.  The truth has to come out about the Word of God, the revelation of Jesus Christ. This is a revelation.  He didn't just die 
    for the resurrection for crying out loud.  He died that a people might live and be freed from the curse of death.  That is what he died for.  Amen.  He promised that all the way through 
    the ages: that man would be brought back into that estate, of life.  Like he created man in the beginning.  He didn't create Adam to die, but it was man's choice.  He didn't create us to 
    die, because this is the generation when it can take place.  And it is going to take place because he will have some that will believe.  Amen.  And he knows the exact number and they are 
    going to walk with him.  And they are going to believe his word. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">For he that is dead is freed from sin.</strong>  That is for sure.  Now if you are dead to sin, how are you going to 
    sin anymore?  Do you see what I mean? <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Now if we be dead with Christ,</strong>  That is pretty plain, isn't it? <strong class="w3-text-light-green">we believe that we shall also live with him:</strong> Now, not at the resurrection.  
    We are already dead, he said.  Is that the Word of God?  Is it?  If you want to make something else out of it, it's all right with me. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; 
    death hath no more dominion over him.</strong> And over you and over me.  How about that?  Are you going to believe it?  Or do you think the Book is a lie?  If it is we better throw it away 
    and read the Ladies Home Journal or something.  That is what the Book says. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">For in that he died, he died unto sin once:</strong> He destroyed this old sin nature. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">but in that he liveth, 
    he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin therefore</strong>  Rule or, <strong class="w3-text-light-green">reign in your mortal body, 
    that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</strong> Because if you do it will bring death. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, 
    as those that are alive from the dead,</strong> As though you are resurrected from the dead.  Amen.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-green">and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.
    </strong> Isn't it beautiful? <strong class="w3-text-light-green">For sin shall not have dominion over you:</strong> The way was made if you really want to serve God, you can. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">for ye are not under the law, 
    but under grace.</strong> The way is made. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, 
    his servants ye are to whom ye obey;</strong> If you serve sin then you get the results of sin, death.  If you serve God, then you get the results of that, you get life. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">whether of 
    sin unto death,</strong>  There it says it, doesn't it? <strong class="w3-text-light-green">or of obedience unto righteousness?</strong> And if you are righteous, you cannot die because that old thing was nailed to the cross with 
    Christ – that Adam nature. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</strong> 
    It's a new thing.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh:</strong> 
    The weakness of your flesh. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness</strong> In times past. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members 
    servants to righteousness unto holiness.</strong> Righteousness brings holiness.  God looks on you as holy. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">For when ye were</strong>  You see, we can't do anything about it anyhow.  
    It's all in the work that God ordained that would come to pass through his Son, Jesus Christ.  And you can't make yourself good enough no matter how you try.  It has to be done as you yield 
    yourself to God in all things.  If he tells you to go do what, do it.  If he tells you not to do something, then don't do it.  It is counted unto you for righteousness and holiness.
   <strong class="w3-text-light-green">For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.</strong> You don't have any righteousness if you are out there sinning.  And these doctors that say you have to 
   sin a little every day, that's not the truth.  That's a lie of the Scriptures.  It's a lie.  Don't get caught up in that.  You better plug your ears if somebody starts telling you that 
   because it will take you to death and to hell, too, along with it. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?</strong>  In sin. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">for the end of 
   those things</strong> What?  Sin. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">is death.</strong>  Is that what it said?  Not life.  Let's do that one again. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">for the end of those things</strong> These sins. 
   <strong class="w3-text-light-green">is death.</strong> The end of sin is death. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">But now being made free from sin,</strong>  Through the work that Christ did. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">and become servants to God, ye have your 
   fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. For the wages of sin is death;</strong>  Doesn't it say so?  That's what sin is, is death. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">but the gift of God is eternal life through 
   Jesus Christ our Lord</strong> </p>
