    <p class="w3-justify">These are just some things that I hope will increase our faith to believe the Word of God.  Because if we don't believe the whole Word of God, we can't come in.  You have to know in your heart that everything this Book says is true.  And you have to realize that the Word of God came to the men of old, prophesied of the things to come to pass in the latter days.  And God had sealed the prophecies until the end time, didn't he?  The Scripture says that they desire to look in, but their eyes were blinded until the time of reformation, or until the time that they were reformed.  Now that is a little different than you learned it, isn't it?  But that is what the Lord said. </p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">It is like the word 'charity', when I cried out to know the meaning of charity, when he just got through speaking about love.  And then he comes up with charity – he that hath not charity is like sounding brass and a tinkling symbol and so on and so forth.  So I asked him what it meant.  And the Spirit spoke to me, "It is love in action."  You see that goes a step farther, when you don't just say, "Well, be clothed and fed" and let him out the door hungry. </p>   
   

    <p class="w3-justify">The resurrection, we kind of have been leaving it out of the picture, we haven't talked much on the resurrection.  It is not named in the Old Testament.  You aren't surprised at that are you?  Then what was their hope?  Did you ever think of that?  You think on that a minute.  It is not even named in the Old Testament.  The word isn't even in the Old Testament.  Did you know that?  How many knew that?  I searched and I couldn't find it.  Does any one have a Strong's Concordance here?  All right.  Look it up.  The first reference is in Matthew, the twenty-seventh chapter.  This is teaching, right?  This is some things we need to know.  What was their hope?  I don't know that I can answer it perfectly.  What about Adam and all of those up until the law of Moses?</p>

    <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PAGE 1 END ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    
    
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">The references are in Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, Corinthians, Philippians, Titus, Hebrews, Peter, and Revelation.  Now if you know your books of the Bible, you know that none of them are in the Old Testament.  Yet the New Testament is just full about the resurrection.  That kind of throws new light on some things doesn't it?  But there are many instances where people were raised from the dead in the Old Testament.  Many.  And when Jesus – Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead before he had died and was resurrected, just before.  Just before.  The next thing he did was to die himself.  He raised him from the dead as a type and shadow of his own resurrection that was going to take place that the people might believe when he was raised from the dead.  But of course they were entirely different, weren't they?  Both of the resurrections were entirely different.  Weren't they?  Because Lazarus was raised a natural body like ours.  He was just raised from the dead like they had done all through the Old Testament, because Christ came to fulfill the law.  Didn't he?  That is what the Bible says.  </p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">You know this Bible will just blow your mind, how we think we know it and we don't know it as we ought to know it.  So Lazarus was raised a natural body just like he died with.  It was just quickened, and of course he had to die again sometime, I presume, because it didn't say he had a glorified body.  But Jesus was raised – his body was changed like he wants to change our bodies.  And that is no trick for God.  It is in his plan, a glorified body.  And Jesus said, I have power to lay down my life and take it up again.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Nobody had to resurrect Jesus Christ.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Is that the Word?  He received his glory at the transfiguration.  Now he said, "Restore unto me again the glory that I had from the beginning," just before his death.  But also he had received that word.  We so miss what the transfiguration – do you think that God let that happen to Jesus for some little trick or some little thing that the disciples might see – Peter, James and John – the transfiguration?  It was a very, very important stage in his life when he was seen with his body of light.  Now wasn't it?  And when the Father spoke audibly, out loud to Jesus and to the disciples, and told them to hear him.  In other words there was no other anything anywhere.  And that is when the heavens were opened unto the Lord Jesus Christ.  Now that was another work that was done in his life. And there also must be that work done in us. </p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">We must be transfigured to where the heavens are opened unto us.</p>   
   
    
    <p class="w3-justify">And we know at his baptism, he said the heavens were open unto him, but he still was a flesh man.  Oh, I'm getting to where I hope you are understanding what I am saying.  When he was baptized, he still had to be baptized to fulfill the law, didn't he?  But he was still a flesh man, and yet the Holy Ghost came upon him as a dove and sat upon him and the Father had spoken at that time, but he was still a natural man.  Yet the heavens were opened, in other words, to him to the extent to where he would do nothing except the Father would tell him.  So I feel that we are walking in that now to where I know that I don't even plan anything.  And you've been around long enough, most of you with me, to know that I am here and there and everywhere, right by the Spirit, right on the second, everywhere. </p>

    <p class="w3-justify">It is because the Spirit is so leading. Now we have to come into these realms before we can go on into the transfiguration, which will happen.  It is another work 
      in the Spirit.  But it will happen.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">And that is when the full knowledge, you see.  That's when he received the power to lay his life down and take it up again, was at that time, at the transfiguration.  And his body was changed.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong style="color: #ffd700 ">Matthew 27:46-53</strong>  This is when he was hanging on the cross and he was just about ready to give up the ghost and he said 
      <span class="w3-text-red">My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</span> I imagine it was pretty dark about that time, when he knew his life was leaving him.  But you see, 
      during that time was when he received that full power to take his life up again.  He knew that was coming.  God had to cast everything away from him.  He just stepped out – it was faith.  
      It was a faith just as much as anything that we do in the faith.  Amen.  But also he knew the plan of God because it was before he was ever crucified that he said, "I have power to lay 
      down my life and take it again."  Now either he was telling an awful big story and then we have to throw the whole Book away or else he was speaking the truth.  This is so far from the 
      natural mind that you are going to have to really search into the Spirit or you will miss what the Lord is saying here when he says<span class="w3-text-red"> why hast thou forsaken me?
      </span><strong class="w3-text-light-green">Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias. And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and 
      put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</strong>  They wanted to hear some more, didn't they?  They wanted to revive him. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will 
      come to save him. Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</strong>  And there is all kinds of cross references, but we won't get into that, where Isaiah 
      says almost the same thing. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; And the graves were 
      opened;</strong>  Now here is something we have to talk on a minute, <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, And came out of the graves after 
      his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</strong>  Now I have heard preachers get up and preach it over and over again that that resurrection had happened at 
      the same time the veil was rent.  It is not so.  Read it again. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And came out of the graves after his resurrection,</strong>  It didn't happen when he died.  Now is that clear in the 
      Scriptures?  I want you to read it for yourselves. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</strong>  Now, there was a purpose in that.  Christ said he was the first 
      fruits of the resurrection.  Now had they been resurrected before....  Now I don't believe that these people here ever died again because they were part of the first resurrection.  
      They are back with the Lord in the Spirit and will appear in their glorified bodies just like he does anytime he feels like it.</p>  
    
    <p class="w3-justify">They would have to come afterwards because he had to take the keys away from Satan first.  He took the keys of death, hell and the grave.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">Right, just so we get our thinking straight.  Then all of these keys will open all the mysteries of the kingdom.  So I really didn't understand that until today.  
      I thought it was strange because the rocks were rent and everything and they should be resurrected when Christ is the resurrection and the life, and he was dead.  And he laid in the 
      grave for three days and his spirit went.  Then he came back and picked up his body.  And when he did, he brought some others with him.  Don't you think they were with the Lord, in the 
      spirit world?  And I think there were many of them resurrected and we will be surprised when we see them when they appear.  There are many things I could say that I think, but I have to 
      stick to what the Word says.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">I believe many (bodies of the saints which arose) – perhaps the chosen ones that received their glorified bodies at the time because it only says that they were seen 
      by many in the city.  It doesn't give a record of what actually happened to them.  They were just seen.  But perhaps they are some of the ministering spirits too, of the many witnesses 
      and things.</p>

      <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 3</p>
      <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PAGE 3 END ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    
      <p class="w3-justify">Blessed are they who have believed and not seen.  But I know he has appeared to many.  And he showed me his hands as plain as I am looking at this glass.  And at 
      different times he has appeared.  But that was really – he showed me because I was crying out to see what the glorified flesh really was.  And he done like this just from here to here 
      with his robe hanging down here, and his hands just like I am looking at mine.  And it just shocked me to see how beautiful that flesh is.  It is not like our flesh.  His hands are 
      absolutely beautiful.  But the flesh is so entirely different.  It is like pink, soft, you can't express it.  There is no way I could – because you have never seen it in the natural.  
      The rest of him was there but he only let me see his hands because that was what I was asking for, to see the glorified flesh.  And I wondered what it was going to be like.  So I know 
      that he could have shown me his whole (body).  I have seen him many times like the night that he went up above, the night when my body was changed and I saw the beads hanging but no 
      body.  That is a strange feeling, too.  So I know that he will do as he wants to do.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify">Now feel free to ask questions and we will see what we can do here with the Scriptures.  We want to learn.  There are so many mysteries, and they are so simple.  
      Most everything is so simple if we could just accept it.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong style="color: #ffd700">John 11:10-26 </strong> <span class="w3-text-red">But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.</span> That is talking about 
      being a light of the world. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">These things said he: and after that he saith unto them,</strong> <span class="w3-text-red"> Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake 
      him out of sleep</span> What the Lord wanted us to know really what happened at the resurrection of Lazarus. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. Howbeit 
      Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. Then said Jesus unto them plainly,</strong> <span class="w3-text-red"> Lazarus is dead. And I am 
      glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe;</span> That is when they see him raise him from the dead. <span class="w3-text-red">nevertheless let us go unto 
      him.</span><strong class="w3-text-light-green"> Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</strong>  Speaking of Christ, thinking he was going to be 
      killed, because he just got through telling them in the chapter before. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. Now Bethany was nigh unto 
      Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off: And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</strong>  Now we have heard this, so it probably is not interesting, 
      but hang on. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house. Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been 
      here, my brother had not died. But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. Jesus saith unto her,</strong> <span class="w3-text-red"> Thy brother shall 
      rise again.</span> Aren't we all just putting things off when God said right out plain?  See, we want to put all this stuff off another thousand years or so on and so forth, 
      everything we have been taught. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. Jesus said unto her,</strong>  
      <span class="w3-text-red">I am the resurrection,</span> What are you looking for the last day for?  How plain. <span class="w3-text-red">and the life:</span> The very life that was in 
      Lazarus, the very life that is in you.  I am the resurrection and the life.  That is why I could receive when he said you are living because I live.  The life that you have is my life in 
      you.  It is a supernatural life.  It is not because my heart pumps and because I eat three squares (meals) a day, but it is because his life lives in me. 
      <span class="w3-text-red"> he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.</span> Do you believe this, he is 
      saying to her. Believest thou this? Now pray tell me, if you can't believe this, then tell me what is he talking about.  I'd be anxious to hear some comments.  I would really like to 
      have a clear answer that tells me that Jesus didn't mean what he said.  I mean it.  Come on, let's talk about it.  Right?  Now that was two thousand years ago.  And everybody has been 
      saying the same thing.  "You've got to die.  You've got to die and be buried and you come alive at the resurrection." </p>

    <p class="w3-justify">Jesus said I am the resurrection.  
      Well, if Jesus Christ is living in me and his life is keeping me, and they can't kill Jesus Christ, 
      well, then what in the world is He saying?  
      We don't believe he is in there.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">That is what is the matter.  We don't believe that he really is the resurrection.  The resurrection lives in here.  
      Power over all death, not because of who we are, but because of the work that he did for us.  Amen.  Well, some are going to believe it.  
      Let's read that last one again. <span class="w3-text-red">And whosoever liveth</span> Not the dead. <span class="w3-text-red">whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall 
      never die.</span> Then he said, do you believe this? <span class="w3-text-red">Believest thou this?</span> I am saying to you, believest thou this? It was a fact.  It was 
      appointed unto man once to die and after that the judgment, until the work that Christ did.  Under the law, absolutely it was appointed.  And it is appointed unto everyone that 
      has sin in their life to die except they be forgiven for that sin and clean their lives up and get rid of all of this Adam nature which is the curse.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">But there are going to be some 
      that are going to clean their lives up 
      in such a manner that they can lay their life down,
      but Satan cannot take their life, because that's what Jesus died for – that he might take the keys of hell, death and the grave from Satan
      
      which was the curse.  Somebody has got to teach this message.  Right?  Otherwise pray tell me, what's he saying?  Do you think he lied?  Now if God hasn't given them the revelation of 
      it, of course they are going to (die).  I heard Pat Robertson teaching the other day and I thought he was sure going to come across and teach it and he turned right around and denied 
      everything he had been reading.  And it made me sick.  I just walked over and turned it off, because I love Pat, but I just couldn't hear, I couldn't stand it to see, because he got so 
      close to the truth and then like a curtain came down and he angled off to the left instead of going on through.</p>

      <p class="w3-justify">There are too many of these scriptures.  And I could care less if I live or die, but we must accept the Word of God as it is written.  Don't we?  So there is one 
      you better hang on to (John) 11:26.  And you better get an answer for it.  If it is not the truth then tell me, what was he talking about?  Let's just button it up one way or another.  
      When he says: </p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red">I am the resurrection, and the life: 
      he that believeth in me, though he were dead, 
      yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and 
      believeth in me shall never die. 
      Believest thou this?</span></p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify">But he also gives the key to what we must do to get rid of the root of sin in our life – which is the curse – through the spirit and through the work that Jesus has 
      done.  Sure, most of the world is going to die. You ain't a kidding.  But there are some who will never taste of death, because the Scripture is very plain on it.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">If you believe in Christ, even though you die yet you will live at the resurrection.  Does that satisfy you?  In other words, there is a resurrection for the 
      believers that die.  Then he goes a step farther and he says,<span class="w3-text-red"> And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.</span> We don't have to go that route. 
      It is just as plain as anything can be, but if you don't see it don't condemn yourself.  Maybe you have got to go the way of the grave, and that isn't all bad.  You know.  Thank God the 
      way has been made to eternal life if you live or die.  Amen.</p>

    </strong>  You know why?  Of their unbelief after what he just said.  He just groaned to think, O my God, isn't anybody going to hear?  Do you think he groans now once in awhile?  When the same Word is 
      right here, our Word right here, his letters written to us.  </p>

     
    
      <p class="w3-justify"><strong style="color: #ffd700">John 11:40-44</strong> <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Jesus saith unto her, <span class="w3-text-red">Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
    </span>Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, <span class="w3-text-red">Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. 
    And I knew that thou hearest me always:</span></strong>  How many know that, that he always hears you?  Really to know that he always hears you?  Now he fills the whole earth like he did the 
    waters of the Spirit covering the waters before the earth was formed.  You don't have to holler at him or you don't have to seek after him.  He said you seek me you will find me, sure 
    with your heart.  You have to realize and understand and have an understanding of faith.  And sometimes we have to seek him to understand that for ourselves, but that doesn't mean that 
    he is way off.  And just like he said, you call and I will answer.  He said, they call unto me and the heavens will be brass because he won't hear.  The heavens are the spirit.  Amen.
    <span class="w3-text-red">And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou</span> Father. <span class="w3-text-red">
    hast sent me. </span> <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his 
    face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them,</strong> <span class="w3-text-red"> Loose him, and let him go.</span></p>
