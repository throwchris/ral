    ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.</strong>  Amen, a habitation in the Spirit where there is no death, where there is no sorrow, where there is no 
    tears, amen, or any such things, where the glory of God is the light of it.  Amen.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong style="color: #ffd700">Genesis 50:24-25</strong>  This is why this could be written in the book of Hebrews. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will 
    surely visit you,</strong>  He says now I am going to die, but God is surely going to visit you. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">and bring you out of this land</strong>  Of death and terror. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">unto the 
    land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
    </strong>  He did not want his bones to rest in Egypt because he knew that there was a resurrection, that he was going to have a new body, otherwise what would he care about his bones?  
    He said I want you to take me with you, take my bones with you into the Promised Land, and they did.  Amen.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong style="color: #ffd700">Exodus 3:5-10</strong>  This is to Moses. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou 
    standest is holy ground. Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon 
    God.</strong>  Evidently God was there at the time. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their 
    taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;</strong>  Do you think he knows your sorrows? <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of 
    that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, 
    and the Jebusites. </strong>  And if I get in any more sites, I don't know I'll-- <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the 
    oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
    </strong>  Now that is a call for us.  Did you know that?  Amen.  Now he is not talking about the world out here.  He is talking about the Israelites that don't know truth, amen, and were 
    in bondage to Pharaoh, and to all of these nations. </p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong style="color: #ffd700">Exodus 4:17</strong>  God says to him. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.</strong>  Do you know what our rod is?  
    Faith.  Amen, because it is impossible to please God without it.  It is impossible, absolutely impossible.  If we have got to see everything before we believe – that is what the Word says, 
    isn't it?  It is impossible to please God without faith.  Without faith it is impossible to please God. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.
    </strong>  And Moses had to have faith to do that, didn't he?</p>

    and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.</strong> That little stick. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And the Lord said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before 
    Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go. And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my son, even my 
    firstborn:</strong>  Now what about spiritual Israel? <strong class="w3-text-light-green">is my son, even my firstborn:</strong>  And he called Christ his firstborn, amen, his firstborn son, and we are his body.  
    So what is it?  By faith we receive, amen, that we are that firstborn of the Son of God. Amen.  And that is for the whole world, the whole Christian world if they could receive it, if they 
    would hear the message and receive it.  And it is up to whoever hears the message to send it forth.  Amen.  Amen.  It is quite a responsibility. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And I say unto thee,</strong> 
    God says.  You tell them. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.</strong>  He says 
    you tell Pharaoh that.  Amen.  He is giving Satan a warning.  Let go of my people.  Let go of my Son in these churches and everywhere.  Let go of them.  Amen.  Lest I come and slay your 
    son.  Because remember these are types and shadows for the true.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">This is the last one.  Don't be jumping up and clapping your hands.  But this is what we've got to have.  We have got to hear the Word, whether or not, we have to 
      have it.  If I don't do it, he will send somebody else, I guess.  Which is all right if he wants to, but I know I am going to obey him as long as I am here.  He said when you get in the 
      new building, you teach my Word.  He didn't say it real nice either.  Because he said the people lack in faith because they have not heard the Word.  You kids have set and worked like 
      dogs from daylight till dark either on a job and then you come down here and work.  You haven't had a chance to get into the Word.  You haven't had a chance to seek God, hardly to know 
      your wives, and he said that I must teach.  So you must listen.  Amen, whether you are tired or not.  You must listen to the Word of God, because it will bring life to you.  Amen.  It 
      will bring flesh to your bones.  Amen.  Praise God.</p>

      anything this morning.  God gave me this message in a very short while.  I did not search for it.  So if I ever knew anything I know God wants this message – you to hear this message 
      today. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation;</strong>  Or so great a Word, amen, that God has put in his Word for us to learn. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">which at the first began 
      to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy 
      Ghost, according to his own will? For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak. But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that 
      thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him? Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the

      They are ministering spirits unto the heirs of salvation.  Well, aren't they? <strong class="w3-text-light-green">crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. For 
      it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. For both 
      he that</strong>  cleanses or <strong class="w3-text-light-green"> sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, Saying, I will declare thy name

    <strong class="w3-text-light-green">which God hath given me.</strong>  Amen, and God has given me, as a Son of God. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,</strong>  The same as he 
     was <strong class="w3-text-light-green">he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; And deliver them who through fear of 
     death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.  For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.</strong> That man of promise, that 
     man of faith.  </p>

     <p class="w3-justify">Amen. Praise God.  I feel ten foot tall and as big as a mountain because I know it is not me.  I know it is the Christ in me.  Amen.</p>
    
     <p class="w3-justify">I'm kind of wild, but you'll get used to me after a while.  Amen.  God made me just the way I am, amen, to stand in the presence of God, amen, and to hear from him 
      and just say what he tells me to say.  Amen.  Because God does visit me, I don't care, amen.  I thank God, and he does speak, and I listen, on my face before God.  I would be ashamed and 
      afraid almost to stand in his presence.  And he reveals himself to me, and I thank God for that, that I might bring a message unto you and unto you, amen, that we might know who God is.  
      Hallelujah. </p>
