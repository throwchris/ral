    <p class="w3-justify">I hope I am not giving you so much that you can't receive it.  I want you to receive it.  The Lord just poured this out on me this morning.  You people have to know.  
    The time is closing in.  You have to know who you are.  You have to know what he is doing in the earth.  He would not let up on me.  I didn't want to do this today, but he just poured it on 
    me by his Spirit, that we have to know.  We have to come in.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong style="color: #ffd700">Romans 5:12-18</strong>  <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Wherefore, as by one man</strong>  Adam.  Now we know all of these scriptures, but let's get our eyes open to what he is saying, really 
    saying.  We know them after the carnal mind, but he wants us to know them after the spirit. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin;</strong>  
    That is how death got here.  Right?  Is that the truth? <strong class="w3-text-light-green">and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</strong> Now just hold on. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">(For until the law sin was in 
    the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</strong>  In other words, the 
    word imputed means that it was not charged to their account.  So up until Moses, sin was not what we call sin.  Now that is a strange one isn't it?  So what about Adam and all of them 
    up to the time of the law?  Does anybody know anything about that?  Let's read it again. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. 
    Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses,</strong> Even though he didn't count it as a curse on them, yet they still died up until the law was given. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Nevertheless death reigned 
    from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</strong>  Christ.  He took all the sin of man.  
    The first Adam and the second Adam, do you remember? <strong class="w3-text-light-green">But not as the offence, so also is the free gift.</strong> Of life. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">For if through the offence of one</strong>  Through 
    Adam's fall. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</strong>  Life, the curse of death being 
    taken away, from Adam.  Now it is just so plain that actually it's a disgrace if we can't see it. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">But not as the offence,</strong> Which Adam committed. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">so also is the free 
    gift.</strong> Just like the offense, death came, and he gave the free gift that we might have life.  It is just that simple.  You can take a hold of life or you can take a hold of death 
    whichever you please.  Because it is a free gift. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">For if through the offence of one</strong>  Adam. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">many be dead,</strong> Because of the curse. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">much more the grace 
    of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</strong> He doesn't say to all, does he?  Many.  He doesn't say the whole world, but to many that is 
    going to hear.  Amen.  The gift of life. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift:</strong>  You see, he looks at it as a whole. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">for the judgment was by one to 
    condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more</strong>  He is talking about death.  He isn't talking 
    about eternal judgment, hell or anything else.  He is talking about death. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">For if by one man's offence death reigned by one;</strong>  Death reigned.  It is still reigning.  
    Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">much more they which receive abundance</strong>  the abundance. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</strong> If that 
    isn't a mouthful. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation;</strong> </p>

    <p class="w3-justify">But you see, sure we were condemned, but Christ made the way, and we have found the way, the key of knowing how to live righteously and through the work and through 
    faith of what Jesus has done we can put that curse down because it is broken.  It is broken. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. </strong>  </p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify">His justification, him making us justified before the Father, then we can live.  We don't even have to die.  Amen. God is very serious about this message today.  
    You better get it in your heart.  He might take some of us out.  He has been preaching this for four years.  And some haven't got on the first step. If you love God you are going to want to hear his truth.  
    We better learn to respect and honor this Word and believe it.</p>

    people.  He is not talking about Christ alone.  Amen.  But he has given man the power and the authority to take over where he left off and to fulfill all things.  We are the ones through 
    his power and through his spirit that are to bring forth righteousness in the earth.  Now we have learned that, haven't we? <strong class="w3-text-light-green">The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</strong>  
    Amen, and we are in the last days.  You see we look like we are living right in this age right now, so we think this is the only important age, but people have been dying and dying and

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong style="color: #ffd700">Hebrews 11:1-13</strong> <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</strong> That's what faith is.  It is a 
    substance of things that we hope for.  It is a real substance.  Now a substance is something you can handle, like glass is something – it is a substance I can handle it, but water in 
    it I can drink.  Faith also is a creator. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</strong>   Now you can't see this with your natural eye, 
    can you?  What I am talking about.  So you have to take the Word of what the Lord did, the record of what he did, what the Father has done, you have to take those records and by faith you 
    have to receive, because it is a substance, and if you don't have faith to believe it, it will not come to pass. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things 
    not seen For by it the elders obtained a good report.</strong>  By faith. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God,</strong>  Just think, he had 
    to have faith. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</strong> And you know when Jesus said, if you say unto this mountain, be ye cast out into the 
    sea; now you see, people have said, oh well, that's a mountain, a big experience, a bad thing.  They have taken away from the truth.  Jesus said a mountain be cast into the sea.  He meant 
    that.  That is why he gave examples like walking down the road and seeing a fig tree and he just cursed it and it died and blew the apostles' minds. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">that things which are seen were 
    not made of things which do appear.</strong>  So this very ground that we are sitting on here was created by the faith of God, through faith by the Lord Jesus Christ, which he says he is 
    the Word, he is the Creator, and all of that.  But it is very substantial isn't it, this ground?  And I imagine a mountain, if you see that baby lift and fly over into the sea, you'd be 
    kind of – open your eyes wouldn't it?  But he said that very thing.  It is a lack of faith that we do not receive what we are supposed to receive.  How do you think Elijah called fire 
    down?  By faith.  All of these things, and he is giving us examples, as we all know, in the eleventh chapter of people of great faith because they believed God when he said something. 
    <strong class="w3-text-light-green">By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, </strong>  Why?  Because of faith. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">God testifying 
    of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</strong> The testimony of Abel is still speaking to us. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death;></strong>  
    Now even if you just had faith, if there wasn't a Word of God, if you just had faith in God that you were going to live, you could live.  Because he said you can ask anything believing 
    in your heart and doubt not and you shall have it.  Now if you didn't have the Word, this Word right here, if you just believed, do you see?  Do you believe that?  I do.  When the doctors 
    all said, "You are going to die.  There is nothing we can do for you.  The damage is beyond repair, and there is no surgery or anything known.  We couldn't put a pacemaker in you because of 
    your heart condition, it would kill you instantly."  And I grinned at them, because I knew in my heart that I could not die because I hung onto the Word of God that God had given me and I 
    believed it.  So that created life.  It created health.  Amen.  And I got faith.  I go down to the cottage and I work like I did when I was twenty.  Amen, all day long, a running and a 
    going, because it is not my life, but it is his life that liveth in me.  We need to have faith. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">By faith Enoch was translated</strong> That was done by faith, not by any special 
    thing but by faith.  The Bible says so. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him:</strong>  Because he had faith. 
    <strong class="w3-text-light-green">for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</strong>  You have to please God first with your life or your faith will blow up in your face, amen.
    <strong class="w3-text-light-green">But without faith it is impossible to please him:</strong>  Now think of it.  I think we better work on faith, don't you?  And faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the 
    Word of God. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</strong> Now if you are just praying to a tree, 
    that isn't going to help you, but if you are praying to Almighty God and the Savior, then you will see something happen.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong style="color: #ffd700">Genesis 50:24-25</strong>  This is why this could be written in the book of Hebrews. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will 
    surely visit you,</strong>  He says now I am going to die, but God is surely going to visit you. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">and bring you out of this land</strong>  Of death and terror. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">unto the 
    land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
    </strong>  He did not want his bones to rest in Egypt because he knew that there was a resurrection, that he was going to have a new body, otherwise what would he care about his bones?  
    He said I want you to take me with you, take my bones with you into the Promised Land, and they did.  Amen.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong style="color: #ffd700">Exodus 3:5-10</strong>  This is to Moses. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou 
    standest is holy ground. Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon 
    God.</strong>  Evidently God was there at the time. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their 
    taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;</strong>  Do you think he knows your sorrows? <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of 
    that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, 
    and the Jebusites. </strong>  And if I get in any more sites, I don't know I'll-- <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the 
    oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
    </strong>  Now that is a call for us.  Did you know that?  Amen.  Now he is not talking about the world out here.  He is talking about the Israelites that don't know truth, amen, and were 
    in bondage to Pharaoh, and to all of these nations. </p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong style="color: #ffd700">Exodus 4:17</strong>  God says to him. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.</strong>  Do you know what our rod is?  
    Faith.  Amen, because it is impossible to please God without it.  It is impossible, absolutely impossible.  If we have got to see everything before we believe – that is what the Word says, 
    isn't it?  It is impossible to please God without faith.  Without faith it is impossible to please God. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.
    </strong>  And Moses had to have faith to do that, didn't he?</p>

    and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.</strong> That little stick. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And the Lord said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before 
    Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go. And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my son, even my 
    firstborn:</strong>  Now what about spiritual Israel? <strong class="w3-text-light-green">is my son, even my firstborn:</strong>  And he called Christ his firstborn, amen, his firstborn son, and we are his body.  
    So what is it?  By faith we receive, amen, that we are that firstborn of the Son of God. Amen.  And that is for the whole world, the whole Christian world if they could receive it, if they 
    would hear the message and receive it.  And it is up to whoever hears the message to send it forth.  Amen.  Amen.  It is quite a responsibility. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">And I say unto thee,</strong> 
    God says.  You tell them. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.</strong>  He says 
    you tell Pharaoh that.  Amen.  He is giving Satan a warning.  Let go of my people.  Let go of my Son in these churches and everywhere.  Let go of them.  Amen.  Lest I come and slay your 
    son.  Because remember these are types and shadows for the true.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">This is the last one.  Don't be jumping up and clapping your hands.  But this is what we've got to have.  We have got to hear the Word, whether or not, we have to 
      have it.  If I don't do it, he will send somebody else, I guess.  Which is all right if he wants to, but I know I am going to obey him as long as I am here.  He said when you get in the 
      new building, you teach my Word.  He didn't say it real nice either.  Because he said the people lack in faith because they have not heard the Word.  You kids have set and worked like 
      dogs from daylight till dark either on a job and then you come down here and work.  You haven't had a chance to get into the Word.  You haven't had a chance to seek God, hardly to know 
      your wives, and he said that I must teach.  So you must listen.  Amen, whether you are tired or not.  You must listen to the Word of God, because it will bring life to you.  Amen.  It 
      will bring flesh to your bones.  Amen.  Praise God.</p>

      to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy 
      Ghost, according to his own will? For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak. But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that 
      thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him? Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the

      They are ministering spirits unto the heirs of salvation.  Well, aren't they? <strong class="w3-text-light-green">crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. For 
      it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. For both

    <strong class="w3-text-light-green">which God hath given me.</strong>  Amen, and God has given me, as a Son of God. <strong class="w3-text-light-green">Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,</strong>  The same as he 
     was <strong class="w3-text-light-green">he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; And deliver them who through fear of 
     death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.  For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.</strong> That man of promise, that 
     man of faith.  </p>

     <p class="w3-justify">Amen. Praise God.  I feel ten foot tall and as big as a mountain because I know it is not me.  I know it is the Christ in me.  Amen.</p>
    
     <p class="w3-justify">I'm kind of wild, but you'll get used to me after a while.  Amen.  God made me just the way I am, amen, to stand in the presence of God, amen, and to hear from him 
      and just say what he tells me to say.  Amen.  Because God does visit me, I don't care, amen.  I thank God, and he does speak, and I listen, on my face before God.  I would be ashamed and 
      afraid almost to stand in his presence.  And he reveals himself to me, and I thank God for that, that I might bring a message unto you and unto you, amen, that we might know who God is.
